## Course Description
This course introduces students to database concepts. It begins with a review of the major components of the database environment and the evolution of the database technologies (from inverted lists structures to database-driven websites). Database design techniques are then introduced using both the Entity Relationship model and an Object-Oriented approach (UML). The relational database model and data normalization will be taught as students design and implement a case study project. Structured Query Language (SQL) including Data Description Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language, and data integrity checking will be covered.

Client/Server architecture will be discussed and implemented. Case study work will be completed using current Database Management Systems available in the lab.

## Weekly Assignments
Every week, you will have a worksheet that is worth 2%. These low-stakes assignments consist of multiple choice questions and small exercises that help you consolidate your understanding of the materials and serve as a formative assessment.

The worksheet will be distributed via Moodle every Monday (except for midterms' weeks & the first week of the semester) and the deadline for each worksheet is the same Sunday of that week at 11:59 PM.

**Note:** During the last class of each week (Friday), the final 10 minutes will be dedicated to addressing any questions or doubts regarding the worksheet.

## Communication
For any course-related questions, such as lectures, assignments, exams, course logistics, please ask them under the discussion forum in Moodle.

For any individual-related questions, such as academic concession, deadline extension, personal circumstances, etc.

**Response time:** I will try our best to reply to your inquiries as soon as possible during the normal working hours (9AM-5PM Mon-Fri). If you send me a message outside of regular working hours, please expect a response on the next working day.

## Academic Concessions
If you encounter situations that may impede your ability to meet course requirements—such as illness, family emergencies, or other significant life events—please notify the instructor at least 24 hours before the deadline. Academic concessions, including extensions or alternative assessments, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You may be required to provide documentation to support your request. Concession requests after the deadline has passed will likely be refused.

After 3 days, late assignments will no longer be accepted and will receive a grade of zero. Extensions may be granted in exceptional circumstances, provided that you contact the instructor before the deadline.
